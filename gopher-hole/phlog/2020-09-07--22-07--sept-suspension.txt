And finally, we manage to get the suspension in the woods done!
My dear friend from Bliss of Pain, Wojciech, was kind enough to organize the whole thing, mainly because he suspended as well :-)
So near the Edinburgh airport, there are some fine woods all around, one of these beautiful places happens to have a river as well, surely it's a good and quite place to relax!
I did a suicide suspension hanging from a tree in a river. Such a great feeling! Finally after a while I was able to relax and feel my body again in a way that only a body suspension can give you!
Breath, relax, let the muscles go and relax again, focus on your breath, forget about the pain, that is nothing, what's next is more exciting!
And sure enough after few minutes I was flying around, free!!
Also for the first time since when I started to suspend, I decided to get completely naked, bare ass in the river.... nice! :)
It was a great sensation, completely naked, flying around, 100% free! My mind was floating around, mission accomplished, state of bliss, as someone likes to say :)
Great day it was, so happy we managed to do that, the location was great, the weather was great, such an amazing experience, as always.
Can't wait to do it again, body suspension is a cure to all the stress in your body and your mind, highly recommended!
