Yes, I admit it, I succumbed to Peloton! I had to try it, I had to do something, time to get fit again! 
So Peloton, the crazy expensive spinning bike for snobbish fucks. Yes, that bike! 
I considered alternatives and then, together with my wife, we realized having a Peloton can move us out of our comfort zone, both physically and financially. 
Having put a big investment (for us) in a Peloton bike, is giving us an extra motivation to stick to it. 
We just started, but so far so good I have to say. Every morning I start my day with a 30min ride plus stretching. This is definitely improving my daily routing. 
So yes, seems like a good thing so far, I'm looking forward to the future and to improve my bike performance.
