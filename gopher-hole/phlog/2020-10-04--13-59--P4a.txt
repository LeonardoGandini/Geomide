It finally arrived! The new Google Pixel 4a arrived the other day, with a special GoogleSurprise.
I received a big white box, like 50x50cm, super light, with a message on the top 'get your camera ready'. Interesting! I opened the box, and a balloon flight out of the box! Niiice! 
It was a clear balloon with small colored pieces of papers inside, and a lot of 'Pixel 4a, let's celebrate' texts around it. This was completely unexpected and super cool. The suprise was because I preordered the P4a as soon as it was available in the UK, at the beginning of September.
Regarding the phone, it's a wee nice slab from 2020, nothing that exciting. And that is exactly the point of this phone. It's just simple, works great and it costs the right amount of money.
Did I forget to mention it also has an audio jack? Right, in 2020, if you get a cheaper phone aka not a flagship device, you also get an headphone jack, which makes sense to me. I currently use the amazing Sennheiser Momentum buds, but on long flights (when we will be able to do it again) it's very handy to have a jack for wired headphones. 
So yes, Android 11, Pixel 4a, great combination. Buttery smooth, everything is nice and simple in the purest Google form. This device is really something for its price. At £350, I feel they will sell a few of these!
Well done Google... maybe a bit too late but hey, better now than never.
