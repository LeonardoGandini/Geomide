Half Life Halyx, the new Valve VR game. 
Such an incredible experience. I was deep inside that fantastic Half Life world which I loved so much back in the days.

After a while I finally finished the game and boy if it was worth my time! The physic is just spectacular as you can expect from a Valve game. The freedom to throw objects and move/interact with everything is just pure pleasure.
The story is simple and linear but to me, is the least important thing here. Like 'yes yes, I have to save my dad, whatever' just put me in an empty City17 to punch random object and I'll be fine :)

Anyway, played with my Oculus Rift 1st gen with an GTX2070 Super. Quality and all was just perfect, never experienced any glitch at all.

Half Life Halyx is really a first step in the VR world for Valve game, and was done extremely well!

Sure, I always prefer to get Half Life 3 please but hey, let the dreamers dream!
