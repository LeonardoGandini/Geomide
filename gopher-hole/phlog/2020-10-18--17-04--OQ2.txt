I received my new Oculus Quest 2. Very nice. Although I wasn't shocked by the lenses quality, it's a nice upgrade from the  previous quest.
I also bought the Elite Strap and that alone is the biggest improvement in my opinion! So comfortable and finally the Quest is well balanced, no more heavy lifting with your neck.
I just started playing with the Quest 2, and I'm planning to go deeper especially with the Quest Link as I'm keen to see if this can really replace my old Rift.
You see, I understand that the future might be without external sensors, but for now, no way to get the same responsiveness from a Quest. Did you play Beat Sabers? Yes? Then you know what I mean!
Next step, play again Half Life Alyx and compare. I think the Quest 2 is gonna be great for that kind of game.
