Received my rack console, screen didn't work (of course). 

I managed to crack it open but that simply fucked up the internal organs so long story short, I have now a beautiful and heave rackmoung keyboard :-) The display is gone!

The plan is therefore to buy a new console and use this one as a tray or something since the slides work well.

On the bright side, the KVM HP IP switch I bought for two pennies work fine (if you can survive the old HP UI).
Succesfully managed to connect it with a Ubuntu server via lan-->ps2/vga and all was good.

Time to dive into Ebay now to find new stuff!
