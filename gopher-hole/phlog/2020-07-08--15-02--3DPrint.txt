New Day, new 3D Printer!
After the first attempt I had to buy a new one, and return the old 3DP which had issues with the bed leveling and the extruder.
I bought a Flashforge Adventurer 3. Wee little printer with wifi and ethernet connection and integrated camera! Max model size: 15x15x15cm. Soi not enormous but good enough to mess around.
The quality in pretty damn good for the price (£350). The only downside is that it's not open, it uses its own crappy slicer Flashprint and online service to monitor. But after all, for my needs now, it's not a big deal.
So all and all, I'm very happy with it and I'm looking forward to learn more about 3D printing, there are a LOT of stuff, but it's very interesting and exciting.
