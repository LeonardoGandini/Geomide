Today a played a bit with my Raspberry PI 4 that hosts my network PiHole.
One important thing, I added the lists from https://blocklist.site to my PiHole.
Took a bit to load them but after that, all done! 

I use the PiHole not as my primary DNS server, I use it on specific devices and I have a wifi network that automatically apply the PiHole to the attached clients.

Very reliable, I will keep using it for sure and possibly expand in the future.
