Finally I was able to say to myself: "I HAVE to buys a VR machine for a job". Yes!
A client needed a VR tools for video productions and educational videos. For this reason, I have the opportunity to play with an Oculus Quest. I own an Oculus Rift since early days, but I was curious to check the differences of a OQ.

The device is nice, works pretty well. The only thinbg it's a bit heavier on the front because it has everything in it. All the games on it are locally stored and therefore it doesnt'require a pc to function, which is always nice.
Via an USB C cable, it can connect to a PC and use your full Oculus library. Performance is NOT the same as the Oculus Rift! With a crazy-fast game like Beat Saber you definitely notice a lag in the hand movements.
Lastly, I just started to mess around with the new hand tracking system and oh boy, speaking about laggish experience. Nonetheless it's a cool experience and can't wait to have a real interaction with a real hand trackijng. There's wizard game out there that supports the hand tracking only, I will have to give it a try!

If you are in the market for a fun experience without having to do too many things with your PC, the Oculus Quest is surely an optionm to consider.
