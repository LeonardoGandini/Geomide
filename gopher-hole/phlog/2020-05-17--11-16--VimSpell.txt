Spent a bit of time finally adding a spell check for my vim editor.

This is pretty handy as I just now misspelled the word 'misspelled' and got on track quickly thanks to the spell check.

:setlocal spell spelllang=en_us will turn spell check for US English on. I live in Scotland but grew up with American English so I always write with an en_us locale.

Moving forward, I needed this only for txt related files, surely not for code files.
So inside my vimrc, I added

au BufReadPost,BufNewFile *.md,*.txt,*.tex setlocal spell

This line will automatically turn on spell check for txt md and tex files. Makes life a bit more easy while writing this phlog.
